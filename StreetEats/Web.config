    <add key="fullTestimonies" value="I asked Michael if he would cater for my wedding, having enjoyed his food at numerous supper clubs and work catered event. His flavours are fresh and I enjoy the story behind his food; bringing flavours from his time in Sri Lanka and infusing it with classic street food dishes. As my wedding was an outdoors/tipi wedding, the classic “three course, beef roast dinner” just wasn’t going to cut it. Michael did a great job catering for 85 people with varying allergies and dietary requirements including vegetarian, shellfish, nut and garlic allergies to name just a few! The food we decided on was chicken laksa noodle soup, prawn gyzos, pulled bbq pork brioche buns with salad and fries and a chocolate salted caramel brownie with praline ice cream. What can I say, it was delicious! The guests were super surprised and incredibly complimentary of the food. I have been to a lot of weddings over the past couple of years and it was a real treat to have something completely different; a feeling which resonated with many of the guests who provided similar feedback. I would highly recommend Michael and the team for any future events, parties, weddings and celebrations! Fab food and really lovely to work with.|Street Eats always manages to cater for our needs, this includes vegetarian, vegan gluten free and halal meals.|Street Eats is right up there on the top of my list for go-to caterers. Having hired them for several corporate and private functions, I'm in awe. Their friendly and professional service is seamlessly executed, and delivered with a positive can-do attitude. The food is fun, quirky and original, and can be tailored to your function's needs (it tastes pretty damn good, too). All in all, I wouldn't hesitate in suggesting Street Eats to anybody seeking a reputable recommendation. They've never failed me.|We went to Street Eats supper club for my Birthday Celebration, Michael was so friendly leading up to the day and on the evening. The food was delicious and there was such a great atmosphere. Everyone enjoyed themselves and it is one of those places you always hope to find in London - quirky and amazing food for a good price. Thanks Michael!:)|Michael and StreetEats did an amazing wedding reception for us in their cafe in 2017.
